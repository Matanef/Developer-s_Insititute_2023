			<h3 class="title_first">Early Years and Academic Pursuits</h3>
			<p class="page first" id="first">John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, known to the world as J.R.R. Tolkien, was born on January 3, 1892, in Bloemfontein, South Africa. However, his roots extended to England, as both his parents were English. Tragedy struck the Tolkien family early, with the death of Tolkien's father in 1896. This event marked the beginning of a tumultuous journey for the young Tolkien.
				The family relocated to Sarehole, a village near Birmingham, England, where Tolkien developed a deep love for nature and language. His fascination with invented languages surfaced early, a passion that would later give birth to the rich linguistic tapestry of Middle-earth. Sarehole and its surroundings became a wellspring of inspiration for Tolkien's fictional realms.
				Tolkien's academic journey began at King Edward's School in Birmingham, where he demonstrated an exceptional aptitude for languages and literature. The seeds of his future as a philologist and storyteller were sown in these formative years, laying the groundwork for his lifelong exploration of linguistic and literary landscapes.</p>

			<p class="page third">Samwise means "simple minded" or "half-minded". Gamgee is explained as a corruption of the name <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Gammidgy">Gammidgy</a>, a village in the Shire. Both names are presented as translations of the Westron form of Sam's name Banazîr Galbasi (also spelled Banazîr Galpsi) (q.v. for more information).</p>
