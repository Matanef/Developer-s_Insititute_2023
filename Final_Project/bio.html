			<h3 class="title first" id="first">Early Years and Academic Pursuits</h3>
			<p class="page first">John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, known to the world as J.R.R. Tolkien, was born on January 3, 1892, in Bloemfontein, South Africa. However, his roots extended to England, as both his parents were English.<br>
				Tragedy struck the Tolkien family early, with the death of Tolkien's father in 1896. This event marked the beginning of a tumultuous journey for the young Tolkien.<br>
				The family relocated to Sarehole, a village near Birmingham, England, where Tolkien developed a deep love for nature and language.<br>
				His fascination with invented languages surfaced early, a passion that would later give birth to the rich linguistic tapestry of Middle-earth.<br>
				Sarehole and its surroundings became a wellspring of inspiration for Tolkien's fictional realms.<br>
				Tolkien's academic journey began at King Edward's School in Birmingham, where he demonstrated an exceptional aptitude for languages and literature.<br>
				The seeds of his future as a philologist and storyteller were sown in these formative years, laying the groundwork for his lifelong exploration of linguistic and literary landscapes.</p>

			<h3 class="title" id="second">1911-1915: University Years and the Onset of World War I</h3>
			<p class="page second">In 1911, Tolkien entered Exeter College, Oxford, to study Classics.<br>
				During his time at Oxford, he delved into the study of ancient languages, particularly Anglo-Saxon and Middle English.<br>
				The influence of these languages would later be evident in his works, as seen in the richly detailed world of Rohan in "The Lord of the Rings."<br>
				As Tolkien immersed himself in academia, the specter of World War I cast a shadow over Europe. In 1915, he put his studies on hold to enlist in the British Army.<br>
				The war experience profoundly impacted him, with close friends lost and the horrors of battle etching deep scars.<br>
				These wartime experiences would shape the thematic undercurrents of his later literary works, exploring the themes of loss, heroism, and the struggle between good and evil.</p>

			<h3 class="title" id="third">1916-1925: Post-War Reckoning and Academic Ascendance</h3>
			<p class="page third">After the war, Tolkien returned to academia, taking up a position as a professor at Leeds University in 1920.<br>
				During this period, he published critical essays and translations, showcasing his scholarly prowess.<br>
				The academic environment allowed Tolkien to refine his linguistic creations and delve further into the mythology that would become the backbone of Middle-earth.<br>
				In 1925, Tolkien accepted a position at Pembroke College, Oxford, marking the beginning of his long association with the university.<br>
				It was during these years that he started working on "The Silmarillion," laying the groundwork for the intricate mythology that would provide the historical context for "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings."</p>

			<h3 class="title" id="forth">1937-1949: Hobbits, Rings, and Literary Triumphs</h3>
			<p class="page forth">The publication of "The Hobbit" in 1937 marked Tolkien's entrance into the realm of popular literature.<br>
				The charming tale of Bilbo Baggins and his adventures in Middle-earth captivated readers, establishing Tolkien as a formidable storyteller.<br>
				The success of "The Hobbit" set the stage for a much larger and more complex work that would come to define his legacy.
				Amidst the challenges of World War II, Tolkien continued crafting his magnum opus, "The Lord of the Rings." The epic trilogy, published in three parts between 1954 and 1955, elevated fantasy literature to new heights.<br>
				The meticulously constructed world of Middle-earth, the diverse array of characters, and the overarching themes of friendship, courage, and the battle against darkness resonated with readers worldwide.</p>

			<h3 class="title"  id="fifth">1954-1973: Literary Legacy and Later Years</h3>
			<p class="page fifth">Tolkien's later years were characterized by the widespread acclaim and impact of "The Lord of the Rings." The trilogy garnered a devoted fanbase and secured his place in literary history.<br>
				As the counterculture of the 1960s embraced the themes of the works, Tolkien's influence extended beyond literature to music, art, and popular culture.
				Despite the demands of his newfound fame, Tolkien remained grounded in his role as a scholar.<br>
				In 1969, he published "The Tolkien Reader," a collection of shorter works that provided readers with additional glimpses into the vast tapestry of Middle-earth.<br>
				His commitment to preserving and enhancing the linguistic elements of his mythology remained unwavering.				
				J.R.R. Tolkien's life journey concluded on September 2, 1973, but his legacy endured.<br>
				The posthumous publication of "The Silmarillion" in 1977, edited by his son Christopher Tolkien, offered a comprehensive exploration of the mythology underpinning Middle-earth.<br>
				The meticulous notes and manuscripts left by Tolkien provided a treasure trove for scholars and fans alike, ensuring that the magic of Middle-earth would continue to captivate generations.</p>
