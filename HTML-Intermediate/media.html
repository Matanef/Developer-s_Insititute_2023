		<!-- i tried placing the video in the page but the page was unable to present the video -->

		<iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0sflDPa9zY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

		<!-- i was only able to attatch the video to the page when copying the embed code where additional information was added like autoplay and lets for example take this parameter "gyroscope which i imagine is related to the position and angle of the phone if i were to watch this on a phone.

			i added those comment so you'll know i actually tried couple of things before just attaching this" -->
